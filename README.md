# Zeolite-Genetic-Algo
* Introduction
This code was designed using existing ase code to generate initial configurations of adsorbates within a zeolite framework and preform Genetic Algorithms (GA) to find the global minima. The code is still a work in progress. As of now it has the capability to study a single adsorbate within a zeolite framework. 

* Getting Started
To begin, copy the GA_runner.py code and put it into your python path. The jupyter notebook has an example of how the code should be operated.

* GA_runner.py functions
The GA_runner.py python code is a class that utilizes previously written ase code, and has been adapted to make the GA processes simpler for non-surface catalysts. This READme file will eventually contain information about each class in more detail. For now just shoot me an email to ask.
