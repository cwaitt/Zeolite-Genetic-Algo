# Zeolite-Genetic-Algo
* Introduction
This code was designed using existing ase code to generate initial configurations of adsorbates within a zeolite framework, and generate new adsorbate configurations in an attempt to find the "global" minimum. It is called GA runner because it utilizes ASE's genetic algorithm (GA) utilities. In principle it can be developed furthuer to actually work within a GA framework but as of right now it can be thought of as an Asexual GA. The code is still a work in progress. As of now it has the capability to study a single adsorbate within a zeolite framework. 

* Getting Started
To begin, copy the GA_runner.py code and put it into your python path. The jupyter notebook has an example of how the code should be operated.
